#spec.ports.name in service definition must be named properly (http, http2, grpc, redis, mongo) 
#otherwise Envoy will act on that service traffic as if it was plain TCP, and you will 
#not be able to use the layer 7 features with those services! 
#Also, the pods must be targeted only by 1 “service” in the cluster.
